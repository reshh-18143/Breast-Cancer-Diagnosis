Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
Logistic Regression Model: Building and training a logistic regression model for classification.
Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualization: Providing visual insights into the data and model performance.

Technologies Used
Python: Programming language for implementing the machine learning model.

Libraries:
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
numpy: For numerical computations.
scikit-learn: For building the logistic regression model and evaluating its performance.
matplotlib and seaborn: For data visualization.

Dataset
The project uses the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset, which is available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
The dataset contains features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. The target variable indicates whether the tumor is malignant (1) or benign (0).

Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/breast-cancer-diagnosis.git

2.Navigate to the project directory:
cd breast-cancer-diagnosis

3.Install the required libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Load the dataset and preprocess the data using the provided scripts in data_preprocessing.py.
Train the logistic regression model by running the script:
python train_model.py

Evaluate the model using:
python evaluate_model.py

Visualize the results by executing:
python visualize.py

Model Training
The logistic regression model is implemented using scikit-learn. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and the model is trained on the training set.
The evaluation metrics are calculated on the testing set to assess the model's performance.

Results
After training and evaluation, the model's performance is summarized using:

Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-score
Results will be displayed in the console and visualized through plots.
